A cutting-edge research project that leverages Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) to detect and recognize workout activities without requiring wearable devices or cameras.

## Key Features

- **Non-Intrusive Detection**: Uses ambient Wi-Fi signals (OFDM) for activity recognition
- **Deep Learning Architecture**: EfficientNetV2-based Siamese Network with Attention Mechanism
- **Hardware Integration**: ESP32 microcontrollers for real-time CSI data collection
- **Privacy-Preserving**: No cameras or wearables required

## Technical Implementation

- Designed and trained attention-based Siamese neural network
- Processed and analyzed Wi-Fi CSI data for pattern recognition
- Achieved high accuracy in distinguishing different workout movements
- Optimized for real-time inference on edge devices

## Impact

This research demonstrates the potential of Wi-Fi sensing for non-invasive health monitoring and smart home applications, opening new possibilities for privacy-conscious activity tracking.
